Ooh.
You can dance.
You can jive.
Having the time of your life.
Ooh, see that girl.
Watch that scene.
Dig in the dancing queen.
Friday night and the lights are low.
Looking out for a place to go.
Where they play the right music.
Getting in the swing.
You come to look for a king.
Anybody could be that guy.
Night is young and the music's high.
With a bit of rock music.
Everything is fine.
You're in the mood for a dance.
And when you get the chance.
You are the dancing queen.
Young and sweet.
Only seventeen.
Dancing queen.
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.
You can dance.
You can jive
Having the time of your life.
Ooh, see that girl.
Watch that scene.
Dig in the dancing queen.
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on.
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone.
Looking out for another.
Anyone will do.
You're in the mood for a dance.
And when you get the chance.
You are the dancing queen.
Young and sweet.
Only seventeen.
Dancing queen.
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah.
You can dance.
You can jive.
Having the time of your life.
Ooh, see that girl.
Watch that scene.
Dig in the dancing queen.
Dig in the dancing queen.

I been cheated by you since you know when.
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end.
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control.
There's a fire within my soul.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring.
One more look and I forget everything.
Mamma mia, here I go again.
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again.
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted.
Blue since the day we parted.
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know.
My my, I could never let you go.
I've been angry and sad about things that you do.
I can't count all the times that I've told you "we're through".
And when you go, when you slam the door.
I think you know that you won't be away too long.
You know that I'm not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring.
One more look and I forget everything.
Mamma mia, here I go again.
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again.
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted.
Blue since the day we parted.
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say.
"Bye bye, leave me now or never".
Mamma mia, it's a game we play.
"Bye bye" doesn't mean forever.
Mamma mia, here I go again.
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again.
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted.
Blue since the day we parted.
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know.
My my, I could never let you go.
